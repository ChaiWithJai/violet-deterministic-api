# Extraction Roadmap

1. Mirror decision requests from Violet to this service (shadow mode).
2. Compare output parity with replay fixtures.
3. Move new project creation to this service.
4. Migrate existing API namespaces/resources in waves.
5. Freeze Violet dynamic plugin execution.
6. Deprecate Violet runtime paths after SLO and parity gates pass.
