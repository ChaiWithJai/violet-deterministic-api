# Hill Chart Snapshot (R1)

## Uphill
1. S1 deterministic persistence contract finalization.
2. S2 Gorse + GoRules deterministic reconciliation.
3. S6 migration translation rules for legacy Violet structures.

## Downhill
1. S3 app builder API CRUD after model settles.
2. S4 verification endpoint wiring once S1/S2 are stable.
3. S5 deployment punchout API once control model is fixed.

## Done
1. Initial scaffold and local docker baseline.
2. Initial DDIA audit and extraction/deprecation framing.
