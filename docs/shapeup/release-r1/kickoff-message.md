# Kickoff Message (R1)

Team,

We are kicking off **R1 Prompt-to-Production Foundation** for the deterministic API platform.

Cycle window: **2026-02-23 to 2026-04-03**. Cooldown follows immediately.

Outcome we are betting on:
1. deterministic decision/replay/idempotency core,
2. policy + ranking runtime seams integrated,
3. app blueprint + verify + deployment-intent APIs,
4. migration and deprecation readiness evidence.

No-gos are active and enforceable. If scope pressure appears, cut scope before extending time.

Single source of truth:
- Board: `/planning/release-r1/board.json`
- Tickets: `/planning/release-r1/tickets.json`
- Shape docs: `/docs/shapeup/release-r1/`

Done means released candidate + handoff evidence, not code-complete.
