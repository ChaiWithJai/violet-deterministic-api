# Betting Table Decision (R1)

## Bet placed
- **Bet name:** R1 Prompt-to-Production Foundation
- **Bet amount:** 1 cycle (6 weeks)
- **Kickoff date:** 2026-02-23
- **Cooldown reserved:** 2 weeks

## Why this bet now
1. It de-risks determinism and safety before scale-out.
2. It creates a credible path from Violet to modern API-first architecture.
3. It enables both human operators and AI agents to work from stable contracts.

## Why not later
Delaying this bet compounds migration debt and increases risk of building new capabilities atop non-deterministic foundations.

## Circuit breaker rule
If by end of Week 3 the uphill unknowns in S1/S2 remain unresolved, cut S5 and S6 breadth and preserve deterministic core release quality.
