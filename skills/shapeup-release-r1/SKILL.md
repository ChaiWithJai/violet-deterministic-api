# Skill: Shape Up Release R1

Execute R1 using fixed-time, variable-scope delivery discipline.

## Source of truth
1. `docs/shapeup/release-r1/`
2. `planning/release-r1/board.json`
3. `planning/release-r1/tickets.json`

## Rules
1. Appetite is fixed to one six-week cycle.
2. Unknown-heavy work stays uphill until solved.
3. Scope gets cut before time extends.
4. No-go violations block merge.

## Weekly cadence
1. Monday: confirm uphill unknowns and cuts.
2. Midweek: move solved scopes downhill.
3. Friday: update board and risk register with evidence.

## Output
1. Board column transitions are evidence-backed.
2. Circuit breaker review is run at planned date.
3. Handoff notes stay current in `docs/handoff/HANDOFF_RELEASE_R1.md`.
